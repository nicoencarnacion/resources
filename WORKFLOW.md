# Sketch-Zeplin Workflow

- When using color picker in Sketch, be sure to pick the color at the center of an element, not the sides. This is to avoid slight variations in the hex/rgb values
- Be sure there are no roque text fields in your design as this tends to show up in Zeplin
- In Zeplin, name all colors used in the design
- Avoid using phone templates. Stick to artboards. The output is easier to use in prototyping apps such as Invision.
- Use proper numbering and naming for Artboards just as you would for Photoshop layers
- In Sketch, make all icons and images exportable so that it will be easier to export assets in Zeplin.
